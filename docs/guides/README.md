# Minecraft Vanilla+

A carefully curated Vanilla+ Minecraft modpack focused on
performance, immersion, and staying true to the core game.

## Set-Up Guide
MC Vanilla+ uses Modrinth as the backbone for launching, editing, and updating this modpack. You can download the Modrinth applicaiton at the following link:

👉 [https://modrinth.com/]

The server is being run on Apex Hosting servers and the following individuals are admins for the server:
- RoddyRoad
- JaamaF
- Dyl_Pickler
- TheDuckOfDeath
- TheBookerDeWitt

Apex Hosting servers DO NOT have an automatic restart function, so if the server crashes or there is a major bug please contact one of the admins.

## Creating a New Instance in Modrinth for Minecraft Vanilla+
Click the 'plus' icon on the left side of the application. Click on the 'From File' tab and select the 'MC Vanilla+' .mrpack file, which you can download either from my post in Discord or from the following file in GitHub:

👉 docs/releases/MC Vanilla+ 1.1.0.mrpack

Once the file is downloaded, click the cog icon to the right side of 'Play'. Navigate to the 'Java and memory' tab, click the 'Custom memory allocation' box and move the slider to be 8GB (8192 MB). The other way, and arguably best way, is to navigate to the cog wheel at the bottom left of the application by your profile icon. Click on the 'Default instance options' tab and move the slider to 8GB (8192 MB).

Your game should now be ready to launch!

# Notes
## Settings
The .mrpack that you downloaded includes mods, resource packs, shader packs, and the options I use for the game. With that said, all of the keybinds, control settings, video settings, etc. are all from my version of the game. So, you will need to update all of the settings to your preference. Furthermore, I crafted this modpack to where not only the mods themselves are fundamental to the experience but the resource and shader packs are as well. You are welcome to add/remove/change any of the aforementioned optionals as you see fit, just be aware that some textures for entities and items may break.

## XP Pedestal
Due to a mod not having been updated to 1.21.1, I decided to create my own mod for storing experience in-game. This is my first time creating a mod from scratch, so please be patient with me as it is not as polished to the level of the rest of the mods. I will be updating this mod over the following weeks, which will require a restart of the server and for everyone to load the new mod into their MC Vanilla+ instance in Modrinth.

## Bug Reporting
There will always be bugs we there are this many mods, datapacks, resource packs, and shader packs culminating into one product. Please report bugs as you see them to RoddyRoad and any other one of the admins so that we can fix the issue.

## Rules & Guidelines
This section is going to be pretty light as we are all adults. Please avoid griefing anyone on the server and be cognizant of your fellow players. There are a few, extremely large new structures to explore in-game and I would hate for people to miss out because they were at work and you decided to explore it on your own. The intention for the server is to not speed-run the game; however, I recognize that everyone enjoys the game differently. The entire server will advance to the End and to the Deeper Darker together at a future, agreed-upon date.

Additionally, lessons learned from the last server included weaknesses in the server's ability to handle massive amounts of entities, specifically villagers, mobs, and animals (to a lesser extent). Due to the increased processing requirement for operating their AI loops, villager breeders and large villager trading halls, as well as large mob spawners, were causing a huge excess of lag for everyone. The requirement for everyone will be that they must create villager breeders, trading halls, and mob spawners at least a render distance's amount of chunks away from their base. This is to prevent all of those entities from being loaded while a player is not using them actively. I know it is an inconvenience to build it far away, but for the sake of the playability of the server, you must abide by this rule. I have tools which can tell me exactly where lag is at a maximum and I will cull your villagers if you do not fix the problem. On that note, also please turn off villager breeders when you have enough villagers. I do not want to find 100 villagers crammed into a small space causing extra lag.
